read_specs

    Finding Spectrograms: os.walk() recursively finds all files in the "spectrogram" directory.

    Converting Images to Tensors: transforms.Grayscale() ensures a single channel (grayscale), and transforms.ToTensor() converts the image to a PyTorch tensor.
    Reading Back in All Spectrograms: The list of spectrogram file paths are read, each file is converted to a tensor, and store it for further processing or analysis.


stft_vs_melody.py: 

This approach allows you to read back in the saved spectrogram images, converting them into tensors suitable for use with PyTorch and other machine learning frameworks.
